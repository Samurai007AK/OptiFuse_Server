OptiFuse Server
This repository manages the server-side operations for the OptiFuse platform. OptiFuse is designed to revolutionize the way fusion functions are executed by adapting and optimizing them to deliver significantly faster performance compared to traditional AWS Lambda serverless functions.

The platform intelligently analyzes, fuses, and deploys your functions in a way that minimizes execution time, enhances resource utilization, and ensures scalable and reliable performance for production workloads. With OptiFuse, developers and data engineers can focus on their core logic while the platform handles efficient function fusion, deployment, and management behind the scenes.
